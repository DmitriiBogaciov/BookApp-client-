Define the task to achieve, including specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

1. **Task Definition**:
   - Implement a drag-and-drop feature for reordering pages in the sidebar.

2. **Requirements**:
   - Use the `@dnd-kit` library for drag-and-drop functionality.
   - Allow users to reorder pages by dragging and dropping them within the list.
   - Persist the new order of pages (e.g., by updating the backend or local state).
   - The list is a Tree and user can reorder items within all tree.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Maintain accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA roles).

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Users can successfully drag and drop pages to reorder them.
   - The new order is reflected in the UI and persisted as required.
   - The implementation passes all relevant tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
